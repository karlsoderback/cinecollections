# Functional Specification

The aim of the project is to build a website that allows a person to register and login to their own personal movie space. In this space, a user has a default collection of their five favorite movies to choose which will then be visible on their personal page. Users can then create their own lists and collections of movies which can be structured and themed any way they want to. These collections will become visible on the personal pages upon creation and all of them can be edited whenever. Users who know each other can then share collections between eachother and highlight anothers users collection on their own page should they want to. 

# Technical Specification

Node.js will be used to create the server backend and MySQL will be used for persistent data storage. These choices were made based on the fact that I have used both of them in the past but not having had the chance to learn them to the extent I would like to. They also both seem suitable for the project since I don't see any limitations in Node or MySQL that would affect this particular project negatively. The server will expose a REST API using routes in the Express framework that can be easily used in Node.

The front-end will be made using React. The reason I am choosing React is because it is a very popular framework for front-end development and something I would very much like to learn more about. Its popularity also speaks to the fact that it is most likely a good framework for front-end development which makes me hopeful that it will be suitable for creating the page I want to create.
